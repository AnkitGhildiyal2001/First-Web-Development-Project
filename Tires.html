            A tire (American English) or tyre (British English) is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a wheel's rim
            to transfer a vehicle's load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide traction on the
            surface over which the wheel travels. Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, are
            pneumatically inflated structures, which also provide a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire
            rolls over rough features on the surface. Tires provide a footprint, called a contact patch, that is
            designed to match the weight of the vehicle with the bearing strength of the surface that it rolls over by
            providing a bearing pressure that will not deform the surface excessively.<br>

            The materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric and wire, along with
            carbon black and other chemical compounds. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides traction
            while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air. Before rubber was developed, the first
            versions of tires were simply bands of metal fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Early
            rubber tires were solid (not pneumatic). Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, including cars,
            bicycles, motorcycles, buses, trucks, heavy equipment, and aircraft. Metal tires are still used on
            locomotives and railcars, and solid rubber (or other polymer) tires are still used in various non-automotive
            applications, such as some casters, carts, lawnmowers, and wheelbarrows.

                Applications :<br>
            </span>
            Tires may be classified according to the type of vehicle they serve. They may be distinguished by the load
            they carry and by their application, e.g. to a motor vehicle, aircraft or bicycle.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Applications in Automotive :<br>
            </span>

            <span style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Lightâ€“medium duty :<br>
            </span>

            Light-duty tires for passenger vehicles carry loads in the range of 550 to 1,100 pounds (250 to 500 kg) on
            the drive wheel. Light-to-medium duty trucks and vans carry loads in the range of 1,100 to 3,300 pounds (500
            to 1,500 kg) on the drive wheel. They are differentiated by speed rating for different vehicles,
            including (starting from the lowest speed to the highest): winter tires, light truck tires, entry-level car
            tires, sedans and vans, sport sedans, and high-performance cars. Apart from road tires, there are
            special categories:<br><br>

            Snow tires are designed for use on snow and ice. They have a tread design with larger gaps than those on
            summer tires, increasing traction on snow and ice. Such tires that have passed a specific winter traction
            performance test are entitled to display a "Three-Peak Mountain Snow Flake" symbol on their sidewalls. Tires
            designed for winter conditions are optimized to drive at temperatures below 7 Â°C (45 Â°F). Some snow tires
            have metal or ceramic studs that protrude from the tire to increase traction on hard-packed snow or ice.
            Studs abrade dry pavement, causing dust and creating wear in the wheel path. Regulations that require
            the use of snow tires or permit the use of studs vary by country in Asia and Europe, and by state or
            province in North America.<br>
            All-season tires are typically rated for mud and snow (M+S). These tires have tread gaps that are smaller
            than snow tires and larger than conventional tires. They are quieter than snow tires on clear roads, but
            less capable on snow or ice.<br>
            All-terrain tires are designed to have adequate traction off-road, yet have benign handling and noise
            characteristics for highway driving. Such tires are rated better on snow and rain than street tires and
            "good" on ice, rock and sand.<br>
            Mud-terrain tires have a deeper, more open tread for good grip in mud, than all-terrain tires, but perform
            less well on pavement.<br>
            High-performance tires are rated for speeds up to 168 miles per hour (270 km/h) and ultra-high-performance
            tires are rated for speeds up to 186 miles per hour (299 km/h), but have harsher ride characteristics and
            durability.<br><br>
            Other types of light-duty automotive tires include run-flat tires and race car tires:<br><br>

            Run-flat tires obviate the need for a spare tire, because they can be travelled on at a reduced speed in the
            event of a puncture, using a stiff sidewall to prevent damage to the tire rim. Vehicles without run-flat
            tires rely on a spare tire, which may be a compact tire, to replace a damaged tire.<br>
            Race car tires come in three main categories, DOT (street-legal), slick, and rain. Race car tires are
            designed to maximize cornering and acceleration friction at the expense of longevity. Racing slicks have no
            tread to maximize contact with the pavement and rain tires have channels to eject water to avoid
            hydroplaning.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Heavy duty :<br>
            </span>
            Heavy duty tires for large trucks and buses come in a variety of profiles and carry loads in the range of
            4,000 to 5,500 pounds (1,800 to 2,500 kg) on the drive wheel. These are typically mounted in tandem on
            the drive axle.<br><br>

            Truck tires come in a variety of profiles that include "low profile" with a section height that is 70 to 45%
            of the tread width, "wide-base" for heavy vehicles, and a "super-single" tire that has the same total
            contact pressure as a dual-mounted tire combination.<br>
            Off-road tires are used on construction vehicles, agricultural and forestry equipment and other applications
            that take place on soft terrain. The category also includes machinery that travels over hardened surfaces at
            industrial sites, ports and airports. Tires designed for soft terrain have a deep, wide tread to provide
            traction in loose dirt, mud, sand, or gravel.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Applications in other :<br>
            </span>
            Aircraft, bicycle and a variety of industrial applications have distinct design requirements.<br><br>

            Aircraft tires are designed for landing on paved surfaces and rely on their landing gear to absorb the shock
            of landing. To conserve weight and space required, they are typically small in proportion to the vehicle
            that they support. Most are radial-ply construction. They are designed for a peak load when the aircraft is
            stationary, although side loads upon landing are an important factor. Although hydroplaning is a concern
            for aircraft tires, they typically have radial grooves and no lateral grooves or sipes. Some light
            aircraft employ large-diameter, low-pressure tundra tires for landing on unprepared surfaces in wilderness
            areas.<br>
            Bicycle tires may be designed for riding on roads or over unimproved terrain and may be mounted on vehicles
            with more than two wheels. There are three main types: clincher, wired and tubular. Most bicycle tires
            are clincher and have a bead that presses against the wheel rim. An inner tube provides the air pressure and
            the contact pressure between bead and wheel rim.<br>
            Industrial tires support such vehicles as forklifts, tractors, excavators, road rollers, and bucket loaders.
            Those used on smooth surfaces have a smooth tread, whereas those used on soft surfaces typically have large
            tread features. Some industrial tires are solid or filled with foam.<br>
            Motorcycle tires provide traction, resisting wear, absorbing surface irregularities, and allow the
            motorcycle to turn via countersteering. The two tires' contact with the ground affect safety, braking, fuel
            economy, noise, and rider comfort.<br>


            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Construction types :<br>
            </span>

            Tire construction spans pneumatic tires used on cars, trucks and aircraft, but also includes non-automotive
            applications with slow-moving, light-duty, or railroad applications, which may have non-pneumatic tires.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Automotive :<br>
            </span>
            Following the 1968 Consumer Reports announcement of the superiority of the radial design, radial tires began
            an inexorable climb in market share, reaching 100% of the North America market in the 1980s. Radial tire
            technology is now the standard design for essentially all automotive tires, but other methods have been
            used.<br><br>

            Radial tire construction utilizes body ply cords extending from the beads and across the tread so that the
            cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to each other, as
            well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the tread. The belts may be cord or steel. The advantages of this
            construction include longer tread life, better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and
            lower rolling resistance. Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads
            and in the context of off-roading, decreased "self-cleaning" ability and lower grip ability at low
            speeds.<br><br>

            Bias tire (or cross ply) construction utilizes body ply cords that extend diagonally from bead to bead,
            usually at angles in the range of 30 to 40 degrees, with successive plies laid at opposing angles forming a
            crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. The design allows the entire tire body to flex easily,
            providing the main advantage of this construction, a smooth ride on rough surfaces. This cushioning
            characteristic also causes the major disadvantages of a bias tire: increased rolling resistance and less
            control and traction at higher speeds.<br><br>

            A belted bias tire starts with two or more bias-plies to which stabilizer belts are bonded directly beneath
            the tread. This construction provides smoother ride that is similar to the bias tire, while lessening
            rolling resistance because the belts increase tread stiffness. The design was introduced by Armstrong, while
            Goodyear made it popular with the "Polyglas" trademark tire featuring a polyester carcass with belts of
            fiberglass. The "belted" tire starts two main plies of polyester, rayon, or nylon annealed as in
            conventional tires, and then placed on top are circumferential belts at different angles that improve
            performance compared to non-belted bias tires. The belts may be fiberglass or steel.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Other :<br>
            </span>

            Tubeless tires are pneumatic tires that do not require a separate inner tube.<br><br>

            Semi-pneumatic tires have a hollow center, but they are not pressurized. They are light-weight, low-cost,
            puncture proof, and provide cushioning. These tires often come as a complete assembly with the wheel and
            even integral ball bearings. They are used on lawn mowers, wheelchairs, and wheelbarrows. They can also be
            rugged, typically used in industrial applications, and are designed to not pull off their rim under use.<br><br>

            An airless tire is a non-pneumatic tire that is not supported by air pressure. They are most commonly used
            on small vehicles, such as golf carts, and on utility vehicles in situations where the risk of puncture is
            high, such as on construction equipment. Many tires used in industrial and commercial applications are
            non-pneumatic, and are manufactured from solid rubber and plastic compounds via molding operations. Solid
            tires include those used for lawn mowers, skateboards, golf carts, scooters, and many types of light
            industrial vehicles, carts, and trailers. One of the most common applications for solid tires is for
            material handling equipment (forklifts). Such tires are installed by means of a hydraulic tire press.<br><br>

            Wooden wheels for horse-drawn vehicles usually have a wrought iron tire. This construction was extended to
            waggons on horse-drawn tramways, rolling on granite setts or cast iron rails.<br><br>

            The wheels of some railway engines and older types of rolling stock are fitted with railway tires in order
            to prevent the need to replace the entirety of a wheel. The tire, usually made of steel, surrounds the wheel
            and is primarily held in place by interference fit.<br><br>

            Aircraft tires may operate at pressures that exceed 200 pounds per square inch (14 bar; 1,400 kPa). Some
            aircraft tires are inflated with nitrogen to "eliminate the possibility of a chemical reaction between
            atmospheric oxygen and volatile gases from the tire inner liner producing a tire explosion".<br><br>
