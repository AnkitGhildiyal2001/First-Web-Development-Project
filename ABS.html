            An anti-lock braking system (ABS) is a safety anti-skid braking system used on aircraft and on land
            vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, trucks, and buses. ABS operates by preventing the wheels from
            locking up during braking, thereby maintaining tractive contact with the road surface and allowing the
            driver to maintain more control over the vehicle.

            ABS is an automated system that uses the principles of threshold braking and cadence braking, techniques
            which were once practiced by skillful drivers before ABS was widespread. ABS operates at a much faster rate
            and more effectively than most drivers could manage. Although ABS generally offers improved vehicle control
            and decreases stopping distances on dry and some slippery surfaces, on loose gravel or snow-covered surfaces
            ABS may significantly increase braking distance, while still improving steering control. Since ABS
            was introduced in production vehicles, such systems have become increasingly sophisticated and effective.
            Modern versions may not only prevent wheel lock under braking, but may also alter the front-to-rear brake
            bias. This latter function, depending on its specific capabilities and implementation, is known variously as
            electronic brakeforce distribution, traction control system, emergency brake assist, or electronic stability
            control (ESC).

            How Does Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) Technology In Cars Work?
            <br><br>

        <div class="text_style">
            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Operation :<br>
            </span>
            The anti-lock brake controller is also known as the CAB (Controller Anti-lock Brake).<br><br>

            Typically ABS includes a central electronic control unit (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, and at least two
            hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each
            wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition
            indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the
            affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if
            the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel
            is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated
            continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply
            or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with
            ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.<br><br>

            The ECU is programmed to disregard differences in wheel rotative speed below a critical threshold because
            when the car is turning, the two wheels towards the center of the curve turn slower than the outer two. For
            this same reason, a differential is used in virtually all roadgoing vehicles.<br><br>

            If a fault develops in any part of the ABS, a warning light will usually be illuminated on the vehicle
            instrument panel, and the ABS will be disabled until the fault is rectified.<br><br>

            Modern ABS applies individual brake pressure to all four wheels through a control system of hub-mounted
            sensors and a dedicated micro-controller. ABS is offered or comes standard on most road vehicles produced
            today and is the foundation for electronic stability control systems, which are rapidly increasing in
            popularity due to the vast reduction in the price of vehicle electronics over the years.<br><br>

            Modern electronic stability control systems are an evolution of the ABS concept. Here, a minimum of two
            additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a steering wheel angle sensor and a
            gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction
            taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake
            the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle
            goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake
            Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels on the inside of the curve should brake more than
            wheels on the outside, and by how much.<br><br>

            ABS equipment may also be used to implement a traction control system (TCS) on the acceleration of the
            vehicle. If, when accelerating, the tire loses traction, the ABS controller can detect the situation and
            take suitable action so that traction is regained. More sophisticated versions of this can also control
            throttle levels and brakes simultaneously.<br><br>

            The speed sensors of ABS are sometimes used in indirect tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), which can
            detect under-inflation of the tire(s) by the difference in the rotational speed of wheels.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Components :<br>
            </span>
            There are four main components of ABS: wheel speed sensors, valves, a pump, and a controller.<br>

            <span style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">
                ABS speed sensors :<br>
            </span>
            Speed sensors(Encoders)<br>
            A speed sensor is used to determine the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel. These sensors use a
            magnet and a Hall effect sensor, or a toothed wheel and an electromagnetic coil to generate a signal. The
            rotation of the wheel or differential induces a magnetic field around the sensor. The fluctuations of this
            magnetic field generate a voltage in the sensor. Since the voltage induced in the sensor is a result of the
            rotating wheel, this sensor can become inaccurate at slow speeds. The slower rotation of the wheel can cause
            inaccurate fluctuations in the magnetic field and thus cause inaccurate readings to the controller.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Valves :<br>
            </span>
            There is a valve in the brake line of each brake controlled by the ABS. On some systems, the valve has three
            positions:<br>
            In position one, the valve is open; pressure from the master cylinder is passed right through to the brake.<br>
            In position two, the valve blocks the line, isolating that brake from the master cylinder. This prevents the
            pressure from rising further should the driver push the brake pedal harder.<br>
            In position three, the valve releases some of the pressure from the brake.<br><br>

            Partially disassembled four-channel hydraulic control unit containing motor, pump and valves
            The majority of problems with the valve system occur due to clogged valves. When a valve is clogged it is
            unable to open, close, or change position. An inoperable valve will prevent the system from modulating the
            valves and controlling pressure supplied to the brakes.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Electronic control module (PUMP) :<br>
            </span>
            The pump in the ABS is used to restore the pressure to the hydraulic brakes after the valves have released
            it. A signal from the controller will release the valve at the detection of wheel slip. After a valve
            releases the pressure supplied from the user, the pump is used to restore the desired amount of pressure to
            the braking system. The controller will modulate the pump's status in order to provide the desired amount of
            pressure and reduce slipping.<br><br>
            
            <span style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Controller :<br>
            </span>
            The controller is an ECU type unit in the car which receives information from each individual wheel speed
            sensor. If a wheel loses traction, the signal is sent to the controller. The controller will then limit the
            brake force (EBD) and activate the ABS modulator which actuates the braking valves on and off.<br><br>
            
            <span style="font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Use<br>
            </span>
            There are many different variations and control algorithms for use in ABS. One of the simpler systems works
            as follows:<br><br>

            The controller monitors the speed sensors at all times. It is looking for decelerations in the wheel that
            are out of the ordinary. Right before a wheel locks up, it will experience a rapid deceleration. If left
            unchecked, the wheel would stop much more quickly than any car could. It might take a car five seconds to
            stop from 60 mph (96.6 km/h) under ideal conditions, but a wheel that locks up could stop spinning in less
            than a second.<br><br>
            The ABS controller knows that such a rapid deceleration of the car is impossible (and in actuality the rapid
            deceleration means the wheel is about to slip), so it reduces the pressure to that brake until it sees an
            acceleration, then it increases the pressure until it sees the deceleration again. It can do this very
            quickly before the wheel can actually significantly change speed. The result is that the wheel slows down at
            the same rate as the car, with the brakes keeping the wheels very near the point at which they will start to
            lock up. This gives the system maximum braking power.<br><br>
            This replaces the need to manually pump the brakes while driving on a slippery or a low traction surface,
            allowing to steer even in most emergency braking conditions.<br><br>
            When the ABS is in operation the driver will feel a pulsing in the brake pedal; this comes from the rapid
            opening and closing of the valves. This pulsing also tells the driver that the ABS has been triggered.<br><br>
            
            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Brake types<br>
            </span>
            Anti-lock braking systems use different schemes depending on the type of brakes in use. They can be
            differentiated by the number of channels: that is, how many valves that are individually controlled—and the
            number of speed sensors.<br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">1) Four-channel, four-sensor ABS<br></span>
            There is a speed sensor on all four wheels and a separate valve for all four wheels. With this setup, the
            controller monitors each wheel individually to make sure it is achieving maximum braking force.<br><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">2) Three-channel, four-sensor ABS<br></span>
            There is a speed sensor on all four wheels and a separate valve for each of the front wheels, but only one
            valve for both of the rear wheels. Older vehicles with four-wheel ABS usually use this type.<br><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">3) Three-channel, three-sensor ABS<br></span>
            This scheme, commonly found on pickup trucks with four-wheel ABS, has a speed sensor and a valve for each of
            the front wheels, with one valve and one sensor for both rear wheels. The speed sensor for the rear wheels
            is located in the rear axle. This system provides individual control of the front wheels, so they can both
            achieve maximum braking force. The rear wheels, however, are monitored together; they both have to start to
            lock up before the ABS will activate on the rear. With this system, it is possible that one of the rear
            wheels will lock during a stop, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is easy to identify, as there are
            no individual speed sensors for the rear wheels.<br><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">4) Two-channel, four-sensor ABS<br></span>
            This system, commonly found on passenger cars from the late '80s through the mid-1990s, uses a speed sensor
            at each wheel, with one control valve each for the front and rear wheels as a pair. If the speed sensor
            detects lock up at any individual wheel, the control module pulses the valve for both wheels on that end of

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">5) One-channel, one-sensor ABS<br></span>
            This system is commonly found on pickup trucks, SUVs, and vans with rear-wheel ABS. It has one valve, which
            controls both rear wheels, and a one-speed sensor, located in the rear axle. This system operates the same
            as the rear end of a three-channel system. The rear wheels are monitored together and they both have to
            start to lock up before the ABS kicks in. In this system it is also possible that one of the rear wheels
            will lock, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is also easy to identify, as there are no individual
            speed sensors for any of the wheels.<br><br>

            A toothed-wheel ABS sensor. These are the front brake discs on a BMW R1150GS. The toothed ABS ring indicates
            that this bike was manufactured before November 2002.<br><br>

            On a motorcycle, an anti-lock brake system prevents the wheels of a powered two wheeler from locking during
            braking situations. Based on information from wheel speed sensors the ABS unit adjusts the pressure of the
            brake fluid in order to keep traction during deceleration to avoid accidents. Motorcycle ABS helps the rider
            to maintain stability during braking and to decrease the stopping distance. It provides traction even on low
            friction surfaces. While older ABS models are derived from cars, recent ABS is the result of research,
            oriented on the specifics of motorcycles in case of size, weight, and functionality. National and
            international organizations evaluate Motorcycle ABS as an important factor to increase safety and reduce
            motorcycle accident numbers. The European Commission passed legislation in 2012 that made the fitment with
            ABS for all new motorcycles above 125 cm3 to be mandatory from 1 January 2016. Consumer Reports said in 2016
            that "ABS is commonly offered on large, expensive models, but it has been spreading to several entry-level
            sportbikes and midsized bikes"<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Safety :<br>
            </span>
            The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) conducted a study on the effectiveness of ABS for
            motorcycles and came to the conclusion that motorcycles above 250 cm3 without ABS are 37 percent more likely
            to be involved in fatal crashes and a study of the Swedish Road Administration came to the conclusion that
            48 percent of all severe and fatal motorcycle accidents above 125 cm3 could be avoided due to motorcycle
            ABS.<br><br>

            These studies caused the EU commission to initiate a legislative process in 2010 that was passed in 2012 and
            led to ABS for motorcycles above 125 cm3 becoming mandatory from 2016 onwards. Organizations like the
            Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile and the Institute of advanced Motorists (IAM) demanded the
            implementation of this legislation already for 2015. On the other hand, some motorcycle riders are
            protesting against a compulsory ABS for all bikes because they call for a possibility to switch the system
            off, for off-road usage or for other reasons. In 2011 the United Nations (UN) started the Decade
            of Action for Road Safety. The main goal is to save 5 million lives until 2020 through global
            cooperation. One part of their global plan is to: Encourage universal deployment of crash avoidance
            technologies with proven effectiveness such as Electronic Stability Control and Anti-Lock Braking Systems in
            motorcycles.<br><br>

            In 2000 a British study considered the ABS did not perform fully because people did not understand how it
            works.<br><br>
