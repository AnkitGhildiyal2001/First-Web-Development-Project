            A motorcycle transmission is a transmission created specifically for motorcycle applications. They may also
            be found in use on other light vehicles such as motor tricycles and quadbikes, go-karts, offroad buggies,
            auto rickshaws, mowers, and other utility vehicles, microcars, and even some superlight racing cars.

                Manual gearing :<br>
            </span> 
            Most manual transmission two-wheelers use a sequential gearbox. Most motorcycles (except scooters) change
            gears (of which they increasingly have five or six) by a foot-shift lever. On a typical motorcycle, either
            first or second gear can be directly selected from neutral, but higher gears may only be accessed in order â€“
            it is not possible to shift from second gear to fourth gear without shifting through third gear. A
            five-speed of this configuration would be known as "one down, four up" because of the placement of the gears
            with relation to neutral, though some motorcycle gearboxes and/or shift mechanisms can be reversed so that a
            "one up, four down" shifting pattern can be used. Neutral is to be found "half a click" away from first and
            second gears, so shifting directly between the two gears can be made in a single movement.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Automatic :<br>
            </span> 
            Fully-automatic transmissions are far less common on motorcycles than manuals, and are mostly found only on
            motor scooters, mopeds, underbones, minibikes, and some custom cruisers and exotic sports bikes. Types
            include: hydraulic automatic transmission, continuously variable transmission, and dual-clutch automatic
            transmissions.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Semi-automatic :<br>
            </span> 
            Semi-automatic transmissions on motorcycles are also referred to as auto-clutch transmissions, or sometimes,
            clutchless manual transmissions. They function in the same way as a conventional fully-manual motorcycle
            with a sequential gearbox, except they utilize a fully-automatic clutch system, or sometimes torque
            converter, but still require the rider's input to manually actuate change gears. They are much less common
            than motorcycles with conventional manual transmissions, typically use a centrifugal clutch, and are mostly
            found on smaller motorcycles, such as minibikes, underbone (step-thru) motorcycles (e.g., the Honda Super
            Cub), smaller dirt bikes (such as pit bikes), and various (mostly older) mopeds and motor scooters.
            Semi-automatic transmissions are often erroneously called "automatic" transmissions, which is only partially
            correct but not fully correct, since the rider's input is still required for switching gears, and these
            transmissions will not automatically change gears by themselves.<br><br>

            Other applications of semi-automatic transmissions on motorcycles include the Yamaha FJR1300AE sport-touring
            motorcycle, with the YCCS automatic clutch system, Honda's range of 2- and 3-speed Hondamatic semi-automatic
            transmissions, used on various motorcycles throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and the three-wheeled BRP Can-Am
            Spyder Roadster motorcycle, with its SE5 and SE6 range of transmissions. Some high-performance sport bikes
            also use a trigger-shift system, with a handlebar-mounted trigger, paddle, switch, or button, and an
            automatically-operated clutch system.<br><br>

            It is also worth mentioning Quickshifters, which is an electronic device that allows for clutchless upshifts
            (and sometimes downshifts) on high-performance motorcycles with a standard manual transmission. An ECU works
            in conjunction with a sensor and a microcontroller (CPU) to cut the ignition momentarily and disengage the
            clutch briefly, so the rider can switch gears. Bi-directional quickshiters are technically considered
            semi-automatic since clutch actuation isn't required whatsoever, however, mono-directional quickshifters,
            such as those used on the 2016 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R and the Ninja H2/R, only work on upshifts, and the
            rider still has to manually actuate the clutch and blip the throttle on downshifts, so it's not really
            semi-automatic, in that sense.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;"> 
                Reverse gear :<br>
            </span>
            The weight of the largest touring motorcycles (sometimes in excess of 360 kg or 800 lbs) is sometimes such
            that they cannot effectively be pushed backwards by a seated rider, and they are fitted with a reverse gear
            as standard. In some cases, including the Honda Gold Wing and BMW K1200LT, this is not really a reverse
            gear, but a feature of the starter motor which when reversed, performs the same function. To avoid
            accidental operation, the reverse is often engaged using an entirely separate control switch - e.g., a
            pull-toggle at the head of the fuel tank - when the main gearshift is in neutral.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;"> 
                Shift control :<br>
            </span>
            In earlier times (pre-WWII), hand-operated gear changes were common, with a lever provided to the side of
            the fuel tank (above the rider's leg). British and many other motorcycles after World War II used a lever on
            the right (with the brake on the left), but today gear-changing is standardised on a foot-operated lever to
            the left.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Scooters, underbones, and miniatures :<br>
            </span>
            Traditional scooters (such as the Vespa) still have manual gear-changing by a twist grip on the left-hand
            side of the handlebar, with a co-rotated clutch lever. Modern scooters were often fitted with a
            throttle-controlled continuously variable transmission, thus earning the term twist-and-go.<br><br>

            Underbone and miniature motorcycles often have a three to five-speed foot-shift lever, but the clutch is
            automatic (usually a centrifugal clutch). This type of clutchless (no manual clutch) transmission still must
            have the gears shifted manually by the rider, and the system is commonly known as a semi-automatic
            transmission.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Clutch :<br>
            </span>
            The clutch in a manual-shift motorcycle transmission is typically an arrangement of plates stacked in
            alternating fashion, one geared on the inside to the engine and the next geared on the outside to the
            transmission input shaft. Whether wet (rotating in engine oil) or dry, the plates are squeezed together by
            springs, causing friction build up between the plates until they rotate as a single unit, driving the
            transmission directly. A lever on the handlebar exploits mechanical advantage through a cable or hydraulic
            arrangement to release the clutch spring(s), allowing the engine to freewheel with respect to the
            transmission.<br><br>

            Automatic and semi-automatic transmissions typically use a centrifugal clutch which operates in a different
            fashion. At idle, the engine is disconnected from the gearbox input shaft, allowing both it and the bike to
            freewheel (unlike torque converter automatics, there is no "idle creep" with a properly adjusted centrifugal
            clutch). As the throttle is opened and engine speed rises, counterweights attached to movable inner friction
            surfaces (connected to the engine shaft) within the clutch assembly are thrown gradually further outwards,
            until they start to make contact with the inside of the outer housing (connected to the gearbox shaft) and
            transmit an increasing amount of engine power. The effective "bite point" is found automatically by
            equilibrium where the power being transmitted through the (still-slipping) clutch is equal to what the
            engine can provide. This allows relatively fast full-throttle takeoffs (with the clutch adjusted so the
            engine will be turning near its maximum-torque rpm) without the engine slowing or bogging down, as well as
            more relaxed starts and low-speed maneuvers at lower throttle settings and RPMs.<br><br>

            Above a certain engine speed - when the bike is properly in motion, so the gearbox input shaft is also
            rotating quickly and so allowing the engine to accelerate further by way of clutch slip - the outward
            pressure of the weighted friction plates is sufficient that the clutch will enter full lock-up, the same as
            a conventional plate-clutch with a fully released lever or pedal. After this, there is no clutch slip, and
            the engine is locked to and providing all of its available power to the transmission; engine rpm is now
            dependent on the road speed and the current gear ratio (under either user control in a semi-auto, or reliant
            on-road speed (and sometimes load/throttle position) in a CVT setup). In a typical CVT, the gear ratio will
            be chosen so the engine can reach and maintain its maximum-power speed as soon as possible (or at least,
            when at full throttle, in a partially load-dependent system), but in a semi-auto, the rider is responsible
            for this choice, and they can ride around all day in top gear (or first) if they so prefer. Also, when the
            engine is turning fast enough to lock the clutch, it will stay fully engaged until the RPMs fall below that
            critical point again, even if the throttle is fully released. Below the lock-up point, partially or fully
            releasing the throttle can lead to the RPM falling off rapidly, thanks to the feedback loop of lower engine
            speed meaning less friction pressure. This toggle-like mode of operation can lead to certain characteristic
            centrifugal-clutch-automatic behaviour, such as being able to freewheel rapidly downhill from a standstill,
            with engine braking only being triggered by turning the throttle briefly (and not then cancellable without
            braking to quite a slow, gear-dependent pace), and lockup triggering at a lower speed with full versus
            minimal throttle.<br><br>

            <span style="font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold;">
                Construction :<br>
            </span>
            Pre-unit construction, also called separate construction, is a motorcycle engine architecture where the
            engine and gearbox are separate casings. In unit construction the engine and gearbox share a single housing.<br><br>

            In many modern designs, the engine sits in front of the gearbox. From a sprocket on one side of the
            crankshaft, a chain or sprocket directly mounted to the clutch will drive the clutch, which can often be
            found behind a large circular cover on one side of the gearbox. The clutch is connected to the gearbox input
            shaft. For motorcycles with chain drive, the gearbox output shaft is typically connected to the sprocket
            which drives the final drive chain.<br><br>

            Most modern manual motorcycle gearboxes have "constant-mesh" gears which are always mated but may rotate
            freely on a shaft until locked by a toothed sliding collar, or "dog clutch". Since the gears are always
            rotating and can only be accessed sequentially, synchromesh is not generally needed. To save space, both
            shafts may contain a mixture of fixed and free-spinning gears, with some gears built into the sliding parts.<br><br>
